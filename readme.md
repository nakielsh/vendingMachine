The program allows user to buy products avaliable in the machine.
To do so, run the terminal from the directory 'lab12' and run the command:

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

When asked, type the wanted product. Important = DO NOT MISTYPE products names

```sh

Enter the product you want to buy:
 
Snickers is 3PLN and there are 20 left
CocaCola is 5PLN and there are 20 left
3Bit is 2.5PLN and there are 20 left
